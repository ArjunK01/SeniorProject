		 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
		 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
		 	<p>Quadratics are functions with x<sup>2</sup> as the highest power. They follow the basic layout of F(x) = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Example:</b></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>F(x) = 4x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 8</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Factoring</b></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>To factor a quadratic, you need to look at the values of a, b, and c.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Example:</b></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>F(x) = 2x<sup>2</sup> - 11x + 14</p>
			<p>F(x) = (2x - 7)(x - 2)
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The roots, or zeros, of a quadratic are determined by the factored version of the equation. To find the roots set F(x) = 0. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			In this case, (2x - 7)(x - 2) = 0, so either (2x - 7) = 0 or (x - 2) = 0. The roots therefore are x = 7/2 and x = 2. 
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Sometimes the SAT will reuire you to manually factor a quadratic equation. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>To do this, first, look at the factor pairs of c (14)</p>
			<p>Factor Pairs: (1,14), (2,7)</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If a = 1, then the two numbers in the factor pair should sum to b. However, since a = 2 in this case, one of the numbers in the factor pair will be multiplied by 2 before adding up to b.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Using this information and looking at the factor pairs, we can determine that the factored version of the equation is (2x - 7)(x - 2), since (2 * -2) - 7 = 14 = b. 
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<b>Quadratic Formula</b>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>You can also use the quadratic formula to find the roots of a quadratic. </p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Using the quadratic formula, you will get 2 roots - one adding the square root phrase, and the other by subtracting the square root phrase.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				Sometimes, the phrase within the square root will result in a negative number, which is impossible to find the square root of. In this case, there are no roots of the quadratic. 
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<b>Graphing</b>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The graph for a quadratic is always parabolic. The value of a determines which direction the parabola opens up.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<b>Vertex</b>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			The vertex of the parabola the point of symmetry. The vertex is the minimum or maximum point of a parabola, depending on if it opens up or down, respectively.
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			The x value of the vertex can be evaluated through the expression <b>x = -b / (2a)</b>. Using the x value, you can plug in for the y value of the vertex.
			<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
			<b>Vertex Form</b>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Quadratic equations can also be represented in vertex form:</p>
			F(x) = a(x - h)<sup>2</sup> + k
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			In vertex form of the quadratic, the vertex of the parabola is (h, k). Like before, a's value determines if the parabola opens up or down.
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<b>Converting to Vertex Form</b>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			To convert to vertex form, you need to "complete the square". 
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<b>Example:</b>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			y = 4x<sup>2</sup> + 24x - 6
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			First, move c to the other side of the equation and factor out a out of the right side. 
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Updated Equation:</p>
			<p>y + 6 = 4(x<sup>2</sup> + 6x)</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Then, take the coeficcient before x, in this case 6, and divide it by 2. 6/2 = 3.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			Change the parenthesis to be x - that number, squared. Then, square the number you end up with, multiply it by a, and add it to the left side of the equation. 
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>3<sup>2</sup> = 9</p>
			9 * 4 = 36
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Updated Equation:</p>
			y + 42 = 4(x + 3)<sup>2</sup>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			Finally, isolate y.
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			y = 4(x + 3)<sup>2</sup> - 42
